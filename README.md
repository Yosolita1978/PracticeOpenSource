# Open Source Practice

This repo provides a unique opportunity to practice and apply software engineering principles in a real-world, open-source environment. It's designed for individuals with basic knowledge, offering a practical space for learning and collaboration. 

Participants can experiment with features of GitHub, LLM, chatbots, etc,  particularly within the CodeSpaces environment, without the fear of making mistakes. 

The practice space's ultimate goal is to foster understanding and collaboration among new coders. This is achieved through hands-on practice, but also through the invaluable feedback and insights shared by the community.
Objectives

### Projects

1. Understand the essentials of Git and GitHub and their differences.
2. Learn about LLMs and how they fit in the Artificial intelligence landscape.
3. Practice some projects using CodeSpaces

### Setup Needed

 - For this workshop, we are working in the code environment that GitHub offers in the browser. They are called [CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

 - If you prefer to watch a video on how to work with CodeSpaces, you can follow this link. You will need a GitHub account to follow this tutorial. (Video in Spanish (TBD) | [Video in English](https://www.loom.com/share/d1a4b9d5ad5d44a299eb8ac20c0f9851?sid=1350253e-8e49-4d29-b3c5-b26574d0b4c5))
